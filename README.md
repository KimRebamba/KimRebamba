## Hi there, I'm Kim! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an IT student at the **Technological University of the Philippines (TUPâ€“T)**.  
Iâ€™m interested in **back-end development** and building apps with **database integration** (MySQL and beyond).  

I donâ€™t have a favorite programming language. It really just depends on *what kind of headache you want* :P  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Java projects** and **PHP-based websites** for school  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Web Development** (CMS, HTML, CSS, PHP), with a focus on **Bootstrap**  
- ðŸ“« Email me at: **kim.fernandezmail@gmail.com**
